        "content": "Until the adoption of the Children Act 2022, even though corporal punishment of children was prohibited in all settings,the common law right to punish children had not been formally repealed. With the enactment of the Children Act 2022, Kenya has formally repealed the right of parents and others to administer reasonable punishment to children. Kenya now explicitly confirms that corporal punishment shall not be inflicted upon a child by any person.The Act reiterates the Government of Kenya’s commitment to fulfilling its international and regional human rights obligations to eliminate all forms of violence against children in all settings. Kenya is part of 10 African states that have realised children's rights to protection from all corporal punishment and many more are committed to doing so. ",
